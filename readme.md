#### Room or Chat?

### Todos/Questions

- FIRST LOAD ALL NECESSARY APIS AND THEN SHOW COMPONENTS
- Show unread messages
- Add notifications
- Some context menus e.g. on channel, on message
- Sort sidebar by last messages
- Exclude own user in UserSearch

1. User logs in from /
2. Choosen user is now stored in localStorage
3. Load the currentUser from localStorage
4. Check if currentUser.lastChannelId is set, if yes:
   - load room details and go to lastChannelId
5. lastChannelId wasn't set, check if /room/:id or /chat/:id is set
   - load room details and go to :id
6. lastChannelId and :id are not set
   - show EmptyRoom component
7. get messages and reactions

### Improvement for the future

- Add Redux for global state management
